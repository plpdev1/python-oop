# Python OOP Activities

## Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes like `brand`, `model`, and `battery_capacity`.
- Implemented methods such as `turn_on()`, `call()`, and `show_battery()`.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Implemented polymorphism using a base class `Vehicle` and two subclasses `Car` and `Plane`.
- Each subclass implements the `move()` method differently: `Car.move()` prints "Driving 🚗", while `Plane.move()` prints "Flying ✈️".
